**# LOAN PREDICTION PROJECT #**



This project is about predicting whether loan can be sanctioned to a customer based on the given data.



columns of the data include 1.loan\_id 2.no\_of\_dependents 3.education 4.self\_employee 5. income\_annum 6. loan\_amount 7.loan\_term	 8.cibil\_score 9.residential\_assets\_value 10.commercial\_assets\_value 11. luxury\_assets\_value 12. bank\_asset\_value 13. loan\_status.



Based on the above data our model will predict whether loan can be sanctioned to a customer.



Process of operations



1. Loading the data into a dataFrame
2. cleaning the data
3. manipulating the dataset
4. preprocessing the data
5. creating a model and training the model with training set
6. predicting the model
7. evaluating the model
8. making the model predict with new set of unseen data
9. visualisation with graph using two parameters.





The model has been tested with new set of datas and the prediction accuracy stands to 90 percentage approximately.
